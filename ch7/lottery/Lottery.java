/**
 * Lottery Application â”€ Programming Challenge 9, page 506.
 * Write a Lottery class that simulates a lottery. The class should have an 
 * array of five integers named lotteryNumbers. The constructor should 
 * generate a random number in the range of 0 through 9 for each element in the
 * array. Refer to Chapter 4's discussion of the Random class for generating 
 * random numbers. The class should also have a method that accepts an array of
 * five integers that represent a person's lottery picks. The method is to 
 * compare the corresponding elements i nthe two arrays and return the number 
 * of digits that match. For example, the following shows the lotteryNumbers 
 * array and the user's array with sample numbers stored in each. There are two
 * matching digits (elements 2 and 4).
 *
 *      lotteryNumbers array:  7 4 9 1 3
 *              User's array:  4 2 9 7 3
 *                       pos:  0 1 2 3 4 
 *
 * In addition, the class should have a method that returns a copy of the 
 * lotteryNumbers array.
 *
 * Demonstrate the class in a program that asks the user to enter five numbers.
 * The program should display the number of digits that match the randomly 
 * generated lottery numbers. If all o fthe digits match, display a message 
 * proclaiming the user a grand prize winner.
