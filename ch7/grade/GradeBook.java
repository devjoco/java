 * A Teacher has five students who have taken four tests. The teacher uses the
 * following grading scale to assign a letter grade to a student, based on the
 * average of his or her four test scores.
 *
 *      Test Score  Letter Grade
 *      90-100          A
 *      80-89           B
 *      70-79           C
 *      60-69           D
 *      0-59            F
 *
 * Write a class that uses a String array (or an ArrayList object) to hold the
 * five students' names, an array of five characters to hold the five students'
 * letter grades, and five arrays of four doubles each to hold each student's
 * set of test scores. The class shoul dhave methods that return a specific 
 * student's name, average test score, and a letter grade based on the average.
 *
 * Demonstrate the class in a program that allows the user to enter each
 * student's name and his or her four test scores. It should then display each
 * student's average test score and letter grade.
 * Input validation: Don't accept test scores less than 0 or greater than 100.
